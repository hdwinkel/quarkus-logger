# quarkus-logger

![Ãœbersicht POC](https://github.com/hdwinkel/quarkus-logger/blob/develop/doc/pictures/DL-overview-poc.jpg "PoC")

This repo shall host all activities to create a quarkus based IoT logging landscape
It consist of some different parts:
* Some IoT **DHT** sensors connected with an **ESP8266** to a logging controller
* A Logging controller realized in **MQTT** and **NodeRed** 
(installed in a **Docker** environment on a **Raspberry Pi**)
* A Raspberry Pi **Cluster** based on an **arm64** Ubuntu running a **Kubernetes** Cluster K3S,
hosting a **Quarkus** application
* A **MariaDB** database installed in a Docker container on a Raspberry Pi
* **Prometheus** and **Grafana** installed in a Docker container on a Raspberry Pi

## What is it for?
It is a project for self-learning different aspects of modern development:

* How to build IoT landscapes?
* Understanding modern IT Architectures including Microservices and Kubernetes Clusters
* How to manage modern development processes including CI/CD, DevOps

## What isn't it?
The repo is NOT a ready to use package for production e.g. at home.
The ideas are still valid and the full sceanarios runs but the code quality isn't expected as world class, just to understand the scenarios.
I will improve the code quality and reduce the technical debts when I've a bit more time for it :-)
