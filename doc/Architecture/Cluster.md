# The Raspi-Cluster

![PoC Cluster](https://github.com/hdwinkel/quarkus-logger/blob/develop/doc/pictures/DL-Raspi-cluster.jpg "PoC Cluster")

The idea behind the (Raspi-) Cluster is to understand a **Kubernetes** environment hosting a **MicroService** (In my case a **Quarkus** App)
In addition to learn more about some operational elements like **Dashboards** for computer monitoring and the sensor/meter data
A **time-series database** is needed as well

#### Install the Raspi-Cluster
The installation of the OS for the Raspi-cluster is quite similar to the installation of the Controller:
[Install Controller](https://github.com/hdwinkel/quarkus-logger/blob/develop/doc/Architecture/Controller.md "Install Controller")
As OS it is selected as well the arm64 version of Ubuntu in the headless version.
