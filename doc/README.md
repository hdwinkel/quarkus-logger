# Data Logger - PoC

**I have some Raspberry Pis, wouldnâ€˜t it be really cool to use them to learn a bit more about some concepts like IoT, Docker, Kubernetes, DevOps?**

In the following chapters I touch some aspects of the PoC closer:

* The IoT side of the PoC (Producing/Consuming Sensor and other data from SmartHome)
[IoT and Data Aspects](https://github.com/hdwinkel/quarkus-logger/blob/develop/doc/IoT/README.md "IoT and Data Aspects")
* The Architecture with a Controller and a Rapberry Cluster hosting Docker and Kubernetes and running Middleware and a MicroService application (Quarkus-App)
[Architecture, Quarkus, Kubernetes](https://github.com/hdwinkel/quarkus-logger/blob/develop/doc/Architecture/README.md "Architecture, Quarkus, Kubernetes")
* The Development aspects including CI/CD
